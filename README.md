# Estimating BMI from Face Images Using Active Appearance Models for Feature Extraction

Implementation for a university project. Python 3 using Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook).

1. You will need a image dataset with annotated landmark points for the training of the Active Appearance Model. Here, the LFPW dataset is used: https://neerajkumar.org/databases/lfpw/
2. You will need a image dataset with annotated BMI values. We used a dataset kindly provided by the authors of the following study: Kocabey, E., Camurcu, M., Ofli, F., Aytar, Y., Marin, J., Torralba, A., & Weber, I. (2017). Face-to-BMI: Using Computer Vision to Infer Body Mass Index on Social Media. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM).
